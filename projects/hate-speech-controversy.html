            <div class="paragraph-content">
                <p>The whole project was developed during the 2018/2019 edition of DensityDesign Final Synthesis Studio at Politecnico di Milano, with the aim of learning to observe and represent controversial phenomena from different perspectives, and to communicate them to different publics with innovative and engaging visual artifacts. In this context, Communication Design is used to access and understand the increasingly complex amount of data and information shaping our world. Thus, we were invited to use visualisation techniques across multiple phases of the research process: to describe and understand the observed phenomena; to share methods and results; as a strategy for public engagement.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Hate Speech is a controversial term</span>, as it is positioned in a delicate balance between freedom of expression and the respect for equality, liberty and dignity of every human being. Several treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) have attempted to define its contours. <span class="underline">Legally and politically speaking there is an existing division between the American and the European approach to regulate hate speech</span>, since the will of the United States to protect freedom of expression, as promoted by the First Amendment, has much broader boundaries than what is actually tolerated in Europe. Moreover the internet‚Äôs speed widely spreads the phenomenon and therefore makes it difficult for the IT companies, i.e. private social platforms, to regulate online hate speech. What then bring even more issues to the matter are the dynamics through which certain types of hateful contents lead‚Äîor not‚Äîto actual acts of discrimination or violence.</p>
