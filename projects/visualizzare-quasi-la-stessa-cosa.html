                <p>“Visualizzare quasi la stessa cosa” arises from the consideration that all sorts of data visualization can only be attributed — in addition to being partial — to a translation process in the name of negotiation and therefore subject to interpretative and expressive solutions that the designer will privilege, in a continuos game of communication losses, compensations and dominants.</p>
                <p>The process that brings complexity to expressive clarity is highly manipulative towards the phenomenon that is being analyzed and implies, as we will see, three mediations linked (i) to the text producer (textualization), (ii) to the info-designer (translation) (iii) and to the reader (fruition). This research, conducted in an exploratory and experimental way, has the advantage of de-constructing and re-constructing the whole translation process in data visualization thanks to the tools of semiotics, semiotics of translation and of visual perception, explaining all the critical steps and fundamental mediations with the aim of proposing a design method that makes sense orientation and inventiveness its strengths.</p>
